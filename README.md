### What I learned

The HTML and style guide were provided, so this challenge was all about paying attention to the details and making it match the design preview.

My main challenge was with the text. I struggled to get it just right, but I think it's close enough to the provided preview.

I'm very proud that I was able to make it responsive without using @media. I focused on a minimum width of 375px and designed the QR code content to display at this width. When I switched to the desktop view, it was a pleasant surprise to see that it maintained the same design as intended.
